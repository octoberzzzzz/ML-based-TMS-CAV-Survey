**Trust mechanisms** are essential for secure data exchange, reliable decision-making, and defense against attacks, evolving from **simple modules** into comprehensive systems known as **trust management systems**. **Traditional rule-based TMS** has been significantly enhanced by **ML**, which brings advantages like handling large-scale, high-dimensional data and adaptive learning capabilities.

Contribution-1 Establishing a three-layer ML-based TMS framework for CAVs.

Contribution-2 Summarizing the principle and evaluation criteria of ML-based TMS for CAVs.

Contribution-3 Evaluating the latest ML-based TMS methods according to common CAV scenarios.

Contribution-4 Summarizing work on advanced ML.
